## Intro

It parses SRT files, shows timings and highlights overlapping timecodes! Just drag a file into the app it's like (definitely not) magic!

## Start App
- Run `yarn` for dependencies
- Then run `yarn start`
- Finally navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in browser (chrome or firefox recommended)

## Testing
Tests? What tests?
- Run `yarn test` and be appalled by complete lack of testing
